## Problems with task 2

Had an issue where my main class randomly disappeared on me.
 - I solved the problem by pulling the main class from my GitHub repo.

Second problem I had was that two of my test methods merged into one somehow.
 - Solved this by simply copying the test I wanted to be on its own into a new java file.

The reason for my problems might the fact that i am using linux and a tiling window manager called Hyprland and hav noticed that it can be quit buggy with some applications like Intellij
