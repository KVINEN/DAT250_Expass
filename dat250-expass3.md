# DAT 250 Expass 3

I chose to go with vue as the frontend. 
I do not have that much experience with frontend development. 
So I used quite a lot of time to read and learn about javascript and vue in particular.
I did not encounter that many problems, although I had some problems when I tried implementing security like hashing and salting of passwords.
I tried using springs own security feature, but that also restricted the access to some API endpoints. 
As login and security is not a part of the tasks so far I moved on without it. This is something I might try and do later by making my own security config file to still allow tests and controllers to work as intended.
